xrp-project/XRP,"Platform, Runtime & Acceleration","The repository's primary purpose is to enhance and extend the eBPF execution environment itself for a new, high-performance use case: storage acceleration. It achieves this by modifying the Linux kernel to add a new BPF program type (`BPF_PROG_TYPE_XRP`), a new syscall, and a new hook in the NVMe driver. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Platform, Runtime & Acceleration', which includes programs that 'extend, optimize, or abstract the execution environment for eBPF'. The project's goal is not to observe, secure, or manage network traffic, but to create a new, accelerated I/O path that bypasses the traditional kernel stack, thereby fundamentally changing *how* eBPF can be used for performance-critical storage operations.",
Exein-io/pulsar,Runtime Security,"The repository explicitly describes itself as a ""runtime security framework"" and a ""security tool for monitoring the activity of Linux devices at runtime"". Its core functionality involves using eBPF probes to collect kernel events, process them through a rules engine, and generate ""THREAT"" alerts for activities that match predefined security policies. The provided example, detecting the creation of a symbolic link to `/etc/shadow`, perfectly illustrates its purpose of detecting potentially malicious activity in real-time, which is the defining characteristic of the Runtime Security class.",
citronneur/blindssl,Offensive Security,"The repository's explicit purpose is to disable SSL certificate verification by using eBPF uprobes to hook and manipulate functions within the `libssl` library. This functionality directly subverts a critical security measure, which is a hallmark of offensive tooling. The program's actions—hijacking function calls (`SSL_new`, `SSL_get_verify_result`) to bypass security checks—align perfectly with the definition of Offensive Security, which covers programs used for adversarial, exploitative, or red-team purposes. Even though it is presented as a proof-of-concept, its capability is inherently offensive.",
quarkslab/peetch,Offensive Security,"The repository's explicit goal is to ""bypass TLS protocol protections"". It achieves this by using eBPF to hook into OpenSSL functions, extract cryptographic master secrets, and decrypt TLS traffic on the fly. This functionality is inherently adversarial and designed for red-teaming or security research that involves subverting existing security measures. The tool's purpose is not to defend or observe, but to actively break the confidentiality provided by TLS, which is a classic offensive security objective. The project's description and functionality align perfectly with the inclusion criteria for Offensive Security, such as using eBPF to bypass security measures and exfiltrate data (keys and plaintext).",
Flowmill/flowmill-collector,Observability,"The repository's context states that the code is now part of OpenTelemetry, specifically in the `open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf` repository. OpenTelemetry is a leading open-source project focused exclusively on collecting and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for the purpose of observability. The name ""flowmill-collector"" itself implies that its primary function is to collect data. This directly aligns with the definition of the Observability class, which includes programs that 'collect, aggregate, or visualize telemetry data' and 'export data for visualization or correlation in observability stacks' like OpenTelemetry.",
bpfman/bpfman,"Operations, Orchestration & Lifecycle Management","The repository describes itself as a 'system daemon for managing eBPF programs' and an 'eBPF manager'. Its primary function is to simplify the deployment and administration of eBPF programs, including loading them, managing the eBPF filesystem, and orchestrating them in Kubernetes via a dedicated operator. This core intent directly matches the definition of Operations, Orchestration & Lifecycle Management, which focuses on tools that manage, deploy, and automate the lifecycle of eBPF programs rather than performing a specific task like security or networking.",
evilsocket/ebpf-process-anomaly-detection,Runtime Security,"The repository's primary function is to detect behavioral anomalies in a running process by tracing its system calls with eBPF and comparing them against a machine learning model of normal activity. This directly aligns with the definition of Runtime Security, which includes programs that 'observe, detect, and respond to potentially malicious or policy-violating activity while a system or workload is actively running.' The tool's operational mode is to monitor a live process and alert on deviations, which is a classic real-time threat detection pattern. While it uses tracing techniques common in Observability, its explicit goal of 'anomaly detection' firmly places it in the security domain, as it interprets system events through a threat-detection lens rather than for neutral performance analysis.",
eeriedusk/knockles,Defensive Security,"The repository implements an eBPF-based port knocking tool. The primary purpose of port knocking is to harden a system by hiding a service and making it invisible to unauthorized users and port scanners. This is a proactive measure to reduce the attack surface before any attack occurs. This functionality squarely fits the definition of Defensive Security, which includes programs that ""strengthen... or harden systems before or outside of active runtime attack conditions."" While the author states it is a ""demonstration,"" the tool's core functionality is a classic defensive hardening technique, not runtime threat detection (Runtime Security) or an attack simulation (Offensive Security).",
Gui774ume/krie,Runtime Security,"The repository's primary goal, as stated in the documentation, is to ""detect Linux Kernel exploits with eBPF"" and ""prevent out-of-the-box exploits from working on a vulnerable kernel."" It functions by monitoring critical, real-time kernel events that are often associated with exploit techniques, such as module loading, syscall table hooking, and the use of ptrace and kprobes. This places it squarely in the Runtime Security category, which is defined by the real-time observation, detection, and response to potentially malicious activity. The project's intent is to identify and react to attacks in progress, fitting the core definition of a runtime security tool.",
eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf,Developer Tooling / Frameworks,"The repository explicitly describes itself as 'A compiler and runtime framework to help you build and distribute eBPF program easier.' Its primary components are the `ecc` compiler toolchain, libraries to simplify writing eBPF code by abstracting boilerplate, and the `ecli` tool for packaging and distributing eBPF programs as OCI images. This aligns perfectly with the definition of a developer framework, which is designed to improve developer productivity and streamline the build and distribution lifecycle, rather than performing a specific runtime function like security, networking, or observability.",
trailofbits/btfparse,Developer Tooling / Frameworks,"The repository provides a reusable C++ library specifically designed to parse BTF (BPF Type Format) information. The documentation explicitly shows how developers can import and link this library into their own projects. Since BTF is fundamental for building portable CO-RE eBPF applications, a library that simplifies access to this information is a classic example of developer tooling. Its primary function is to aid in the creation of other eBPF-based programs by abstracting away low-level format details, which directly aligns with the definition of this category.",
aiven/pgtracer,Observability,"The repository's primary purpose is to trace and observe the behavior of a running PostgreSQL database. It uses eBPF to 'dump every executed query' and 'gather information about individual execution nodes to print query plans'. This aligns perfectly with the Observability class definition, which includes programs that 'observe, measure, trace, or profile systems, applications, or networks without a security or adversarial goal'. The tool's function is diagnostic and performance-oriented, aiming to provide insight into application behavior, which is the core intent of observability.",
groundcover-com/murre,Uncategorized,"This repository cannot be classified because it explicitly does not use eBPF. The provided documentation and the associated launch blog post state that Murre fetches resource metrics by querying the Kubernetes kubelet API directly, intentionally avoiding agents and eBPF. The classification system is strictly for programs that use eBPF. While the tool's purpose of providing resource metrics aligns with the functional goal of the 'Observability' category, its implementation method falls outside the scope of this eBPF-specific taxonomy.",
Kong/blixt,Cloud Native Networking,"The repository explicitly defines its purpose as an ""Experimental Layer 4 Kubernetes Gateway using eBPF for the data-plane"" and a ""load-balancer for Kubernetes"". This functionality falls squarely within the definition of Cloud Native Networking, which includes programs that use eBPF to implement networking infrastructure such as gateways and load balancers for containerized environments. Although the project was experimental and is now archived, its primary intent was to build a functional piece of Kubernetes networking infrastructure, which is the core of this category.",
odigos-io/odigos,Observability,"The repository's main intent is explicitly stated as being an ""open-source distributed tracing solution"" that ""simplifies and improves observability."" Its core functionality is to use eBPF for code-free, automatic instrumentation of applications (Java, Python, .NET, Node.js, Go) to generate distributed traces. The output is compatible with OpenTelemetry, a standard for observability data. The project's goal is to help operators and SREs understand system behavior and performance, which directly aligns with the definition of the Observability class. It does not perform security enforcement, networking, or provide a developer framework; its purpose is to observe, measure, and trace.",
apache/skywalking-rover,Observability,"The repository is explicitly described as a 'collector' and 'profiler' to 'monitor network traffic, and diagnose CPU and network performance.' Its key features include collecting metrics, CPU profiling, network profiling, and enhancing distributed tracing. This aligns perfectly with the Observability class, which focuses on using eBPF to measure, trace, and profile systems for performance analysis and diagnostics, without a security or networking intent.",
coroot/coroot-node-agent,Observability,"The repository's main purpose is to gather and expose metrics for system and container monitoring. It uses eBPF for TCP connection tracing to build service maps, detect connection errors, and measure network latency. These functions are explicitly for visibility and performance analysis, not security enforcement. The agent exports data in the Prometheus format and is part of a larger project described as an 'observability tool.' The collected metrics, such as CPU/disk delay accounting and OOM events, are all classic indicators of a tool designed for performance monitoring and debugging, fitting the definition of the Observability class perfectly.",
evdenis/lsm_bpf_check_argc0,Runtime Security,"The program's sole purpose is to prevent a specific type of malicious program execution (related to CVE-2021-4034) in real time. It uses eBPF's Linux Security Module (LSM) hooks to observe `exec*` system calls and actively blocks those that violate the policy (argc == 0). This aligns perfectly with the definition of Runtime Security, which involves observing, detecting, and responding to malicious activity while a system is running. The tool's keywords—""prevent,"" ""LSM BPF program,"" ""protection""—and its function of blocking a syscall directly confirm its classification as a runtime enforcement tool.",
rubrikinc/wachy,Observability,"The repository explicitly describes itself as a ""dynamic tracing profiler for Linux"" and a tool for ""interactive eBPF-based userspace performance debugging."" Its purpose is to trace and profile arbitrary compiled binaries to help developers understand performance issues. This aligns perfectly with the Observability class definition, which includes programs that ""observe, measure, trace, or profile systems, applications, or networks without a security or adversarial goal."" Wachy's intent is to provide insight and diagnostics, not to enforce security policies or manage network traffic.",
gojue/ecapture,Observability,"The primary intent of eCapture is to provide visibility into otherwise opaque system activities for analysis and troubleshooting. Its core feature is decrypting SSL/TLS traffic without a CA certificate, which is a classic observability and debugging task to understand application-level communication. While it includes modules for 'auditing' shell commands (bash, zsh) and SQL queries, these functions also serve observability purposes, such as performance analysis or debugging. The tool's behavior is to capture and display data ('observe and report') without any built-in logic for detecting malicious patterns, enforcing policies, or generating security alerts. It answers the question 'What is happening?' rather than 'Is something bad happening?', which places it squarely in the Observability category over Runtime Security.",
ancat/egrets,Runtime Security,"The repository's main intent is to monitor egress traffic by correlating process syscalls with DNS lookups to identify the destination hostnames. This functionality is fundamentally for security monitoring. The README explicitly frames this as a more reliable alternative to security practices like IP address whitelisting. Although the current implementation only prints events, the stated future goal is to add response capabilities like killing processes. According to the classification rules, if a tool interprets signals through a threat-detection lens, even if it only observes, it leans towards security. The focus on egress traffic, the comparison to whitelisting, and the planned response actions firmly place its intent within the Runtime Security domain, where the goal is to observe systems to detect potentially malicious or policy-violating activity.",
microsoft/ebpf-for-windows,"Platform, Runtime & Acceleration","The repository's primary purpose is to create a runtime environment that allows eBPF programs, traditionally a Linux technology, to execute on the Windows operating system. The documentation details the architecture of this environment, including a JIT compiler, an interpreter, and a mechanism to compile eBPF bytecode into native Windows drivers (`.sys` files). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Platform, Runtime & Acceleration', which includes projects that 'extend eBPF beyond Linux (e.g., Windows eBPF, user-space runtimes, cross-platform ports)' and focus on 'how eBPF executes, not what it observes or enforces'. The project is not an application of eBPF (like security or networking) but rather the foundational platform that enables such applications on a new OS.",
ebpf-networking/tc-nodeport,Cloud Native Networking,"The repository's main purpose is to provide a Proof of Concept for a Kubernetes `NodePort` service using eBPF for load balancing and NAT. This falls directly under the Cloud Native Networking category, which covers programs that implement or optimize networking capabilities specifically for containerized environments like Kubernetes. It deals with concepts like services, backends (pods), and worker nodes, making it a clear example of eBPF applied to cloud-native infrastructure rather than a generic kernel networking tool.",
angelopoerio/tinyfw,Runtime Security,"The repository describes itself as a ""toy containers aware firewall"". Its primary function is to attach an eBPF program to network interfaces (including those of containers) to enforce a network policy in real-time. Specifically, it drops all incoming TCP traffic on a hardcoded list of ports. This action directly aligns with the definition of Runtime Security, which includes ""programs that enforce runtime policies"" and ""respond to potentially malicious or policy-violating activity while a system or workload is actively running."" Although the project is labeled as a ""toy,"" its implemented functionality is that of a runtime enforcement agent. It is not Cloud Native Networking because its goal is security restriction, not providing connectivity. It is not purely Educational because it is presented as a functional tool, despite its simplicity.",
fbac/sklookup-go,Kernel / Dataplane Networking,"The repository's primary function is to use an eBPF `sk_lookup` program to manipulate the kernel's socket dispatching behavior. It allows redirecting incoming network connections for a given port to a socket of an existing process. This is a direct implementation of kernel-level traffic control and routing, fitting squarely within the Kernel / Dataplane Networking category. The use cases, such as adding listening ports to a running service or building proxies, are classic examples of programming the network dataplane, independent of any cloud-native orchestration.",
r-caamano/ebpf-tproxy-splicer,Runtime Security,"The repository's primary function is to act as a ""statefull ingress FW"" (firewall) using eBPF at the `tc` hook. It enforces network policies by default-denying traffic and only allowing flows that are explicitly configured by a security controller (OpenZiti). The program's core purpose is to enforce a zero-trust policy in the kernel by redirecting or passing traffic based on dynamically updated rules. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Runtime Security, which includes programs that ""enforce runtime policies"" and act as an ""in-kernel policy engine"" to protect a running system. While it uses networking primitives, its intent is not general connectivity or performance but security enforcement.",
kindlingproject/kindling,Observability,"The repository describes itself as an ""eBPF-based Cloud Native Monitoring Tool"" with the explicit goal to ""help users understand the app behavior from kernel to code stack"" and ""find the root cause in seconds."" Its core features, such as ""trace profiling,"" providing an ""overview of network flows,"" and offering built-in monitoring dashboards, are all hallmarks of observability tools. The project's intent is clearly focused on monitoring, performance analysis, and diagnostics, rather than security enforcement, providing network connectivity, or adversarial simulation. Its integration with Prometheus further solidifies its classification as an Observability tool.",
IETF-Hackathon/ietf115-project-presentations,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository's primary and sole purpose is to serve as a collection point for project presentations from the IETF 115 Hackathon. These presentations are inherently educational and demonstrative, designed to showcase and explain the work and concepts explored during the event. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Educational / Demonstration Resources', which includes 'repositories that demonstrate proof-of-concept...used in...conference presentations' and 'curated resource collections related to eBPF education'.",
intel/processwatch,Observability,"The repository is explicitly described as a ""profiling tool to get per-process instruction mix."" Its function is to observe, measure, and display the types of CPU instructions being executed by processes in real-time. This aligns perfectly with the definition of the Observability class, which includes programs that ""observe, measure, trace, or profile systems... without a security or adversarial goal."" The tool's output helps developers and performance engineers understand system behavior and diagnose performance, which are key use cases for observability tools.",
ShubhamPalriwala/NetWorth,Observability,"The repository's primary and sole function is to monitor network packets at the host level using eBPF (specifically XDP) and export this data as metrics for visualization. The entire architecture, from the eBPF data collection to the Python exporter, Prometheus scraper, and Grafana dashboard, is a classic observability pipeline. It aims to answer questions like ""how many bytes am I receiving?"" and ""what protocols are in use?"", which falls directly under the definition of Observability: using eBPF to observe and measure system behavior without a security, offensive, or networking-control goal.",
boratanrikulu/durdur,Kernel / Dataplane Networking,"The repository describes itself as an ""eBPF-powered L4 package dropper"". Its primary function is to implement a simple, command-line-driven firewall that filters and drops L3/L4 packets based on user-defined rules, such as source IP or DNS name. This functionality aligns directly with the definition of 'Kernel / Dataplane Networking', which includes programs that use eBPF to implement firewalls and manipulate packet processing directly within the Linux kernel networking stack. The tool operates independently of any cloud-native or orchestration environment, focusing purely on low-level packet filtering, which is a core characteristic of this category.",
groundcover-com/caretta,Observability,"The repository's primary function is to provide visibility into network communications within a Kubernetes cluster. It uses eBPF to trace network interactions, collects this data as metrics (`caretta_links_observed`), and makes it available for visualization in Grafana to create a 'service dependency map'. The project explicitly describes itself as an 'observability solution' and focuses on exposing 'inter-dependencies' rather than detecting threats or enforcing policies. This aligns perfectly with the definition of the Observability class, which includes programs that observe, measure, and trace systems to understand their behavior without a security goal.",
keisku/execve-printer,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository's primary purpose is to demonstrate a fundamental eBPF concept: attaching a program to a tracepoint (`sys_enter_execve`) and printing a message from the kernel. The code is minimal and serves as a 'hello world' example for syscall tracing. It is not a production-grade tool for security, observability, or networking. Its intent is clearly pedagogical, aiming to teach or showcase how to perform a basic eBPF action, which aligns perfectly with the definition of an educational or demonstration resource.",
trailofbits/ebpf-verifier,Defensive Security,"The repository's primary purpose is to create a userspace harness for testing the eBPF verifier itself, a core security component of the Linux kernel. The documentation states its goal is to ""allow efficient checks that an eBPF program will run on various kernel versions"" and to ""detecting discrepencies in the eBPF verifier between different kernel versions."" This aligns perfectly with the Defensive Security category, which includes programs that validate, verify, or harden systems outside of active attack conditions. By enabling rigorous testing of the verifier, the project helps ensure the robustness of the kernel's primary defense against unsafe eBPF programs, thereby reducing the attack surface and increasing system resilience through analysis and verification.",
furkanonder/beetrace,Observability,"The repository's main purpose is to trace Python process execution, including function calls and line-by-line activity. This falls squarely into the Observability category, as it uses eBPF (via bpftrace and USDT probes) to observe and understand application behavior for debugging and performance analysis. The tool does not have a security intent (ruling out Runtime, Defensive, and Offensive Security), nor does it provide networking infrastructure or developer frameworks. Its goal is to provide insight and diagnostics into a running process, which is the core definition of Observability.",
SeeFlowerX/stackplz,Observability,"The repository provides a command-line tool specifically designed for deep system tracing and debugging on Android. Its core features—syscall tracing, uprobes on user-space libraries, hardware breakpoint support, and detailed stack/register dumping—are all focused on observing and understanding the runtime behavior of applications. The tool's purpose is to provide visibility for diagnostics, debugging, and reverse engineering, which aligns directly with the definition of Observability. It does not enforce security policies, manage network traffic, or provide a framework for building new eBPF applications.",
intel/afxdp-plugins-for-kubernetes,Cloud Native Networking,"The repository's primary function is to provide a high-performance networking solution for Kubernetes pods. It achieves this by implementing a CNI plugin and a Kubernetes device plugin that leverage AF_XDP, a high-speed datapath that relies on eBPF. This directly aligns with the 'Cloud Native Networking' category, which is defined as programs that use eBPF to implement, optimize, or extend networking capabilities specifically within containerized environments like Kubernetes.",
vadorovsky/aya-btf-map,Developer Tooling / Frameworks,"This repository provides a Rust crate that adds experimental support for BTF-defined maps to the Aya framework. Its purpose is to enhance the capabilities available to developers writing eBPF programs in Rust, allowing them to use modern map definitions instead of legacy ones. The project consists of macros and library code, which are classic components of a developer framework or toolchain. It does not perform any runtime security, networking, or observability functions itself; rather, it is a building block to be used by developers creating such applications. The requirement to build a custom LLVM and bpf-linker further solidifies its classification as a tool for the eBPF development lifecycle.",
CloudNativeDataPlane/cndp,Developer Tooling / Frameworks,"The repository explicitly defines itself as a ""collection of user space libraries"" and a ""framework for cloud native developers."" Its primary goal is to simplify high-performance network application development by providing APIs that abstract the complexities of AF_XDP and other platform acceleration features. The documentation repeatedly emphasizes its role in enabling developers to build applications, stating that ""CNDP hides the low-level I/O, allowing the developer to focus on their application."" While the applications built with CNDP would fall into the Kernel/Dataplane or Cloud Native Networking categories, CNDP itself is the toolkit—the SDK and libraries—used for their creation. The comparison to DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) further solidifies its classification as a developer-focused framework rather than a deployable networking solution.",
nickolaev/vagrant-parallels-m1-k8s-cilium,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository's stated purpose is to ""create a demo/verification environment for Kubernetes with Cilium"". It consists of Vagrant scripts that automate the setup of a local lab environment. This aligns directly with the definition of the Educational / Demonstration Resources class, which includes projects designed for learning, experimentation, and demonstrating concepts. While it involves deployment automation (an operational task), its primary intent is not for production management but to provide a hands-on environment for users to learn about or test Cilium. The Operations class explicitly excludes ""demo orchestration scripts meant for learning"", which perfectly describes this repository.",
Esonhugh/sshd_backdoor,Offensive Security,"The repository's explicit purpose is to create a backdoor for the SSH daemon (sshd) by hijacking the read operation on the `authorized_keys` file and injecting an attacker's public key. The project name `sshd_backdoor`, the description ('evil file watchdog'), and the functionality (manipulating syscalls to gain unauthorized access) all clearly align with adversarial and red-team purposes. It also includes a keylogging feature to capture passwords. This fits the definition of Offensive Security, which includes tools that use eBPF to exploit, subvert, or persist stealthily on a system.",
cilium/cilium.io,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"This repository contains the source code for the official Cilium project website, cilium.io. Its primary purpose is to serve as an informational and educational hub for the Cilium project and eBPF technology. The content includes blogs, links to documentation, training materials, and community resources. The repository's functionality is centered around a web framework (Gatsby) for publishing this content. According to the classification rules, projects that are explicitly for teaching, providing tutorials, examples, workshops, or curated resource collections fit into this category. The main project website is a quintessential educational and informational resource for its user base.",
mdditt2000/kubernetes-1-26,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository's primary purpose is to educate and demonstrate how to configure F5 BIG-IP with various Kubernetes CNIs, including the eBPF-based Cilium. The description explicitly calls it an ""Example showcasing"" and notes it is an accompaniment to a video walkthrough. This fits the definition of an Educational / Demonstration Resource, which includes tutorials, examples, and showcase projects designed for learning and experimentation, rather than being a production tool itself. While the subject matter is Cloud Native Networking, the repository's function is purely instructional.",
eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf,"Platform, Runtime & Acceleration","The repository's core purpose is to provide a new execution environment for the user-space portion of eBPF applications by compiling them to and running them in a WebAssembly (Wasm) sandbox. The documentation repeatedly emphasizes that it is a ""library, toolchain and runtime"". This aligns directly with the definition of Class 10: 'PROGRAMS that provide PLATFORM, RUNTIME & ACCELERATION', which includes systems that ""provide the underlying runtime environments"" and ""embedding eBPF in alternate runtimes like WASM"". While it contains developer tooling, the primary innovation and function is the Wasm-based runtime that changes *how* and *where* eBPF user-space code executes, focusing on portability and sandboxing rather than a specific application like security or networking.",
eunomia-bpf/GPTtrace,Developer Tooling / Frameworks,"The primary purpose of this repository is to generate eBPF programs from natural language prompts using GPT. It acts as a high-level abstraction layer, simplifying the creation of eBPF tracing scripts and programs. This squarely fits the definition of a developer tool, as its main function is to make writing eBPF code easier and more accessible, thereby increasing developer productivity. While the output of the generated programs is often for observability, the tool itself is a code generator—a classic example of developer tooling.",
cilium/tetragon,Runtime Security,"The repository's documentation explicitly states its purpose is 'real-time, eBPF-based Security Observability and Runtime Enforcement.' It is designed to 'detect[] and react to security-significant events' such as process execution, system calls, and I/O activity. This directly aligns with the definition of Runtime Security, which involves observing, detecting, and responding to potentially malicious activity while a system is running. The focus on 'detection', 'reaction', and 'enforcement' clearly places it in this category, distinguishing it from pure Observability tools.",
daeuniverse/dae,Kernel / Dataplane Networking,"The repository implements a high-performance transparent proxy that uses eBPF to split and route traffic directly in the Linux kernel. Its primary goal is packet processing efficiency and traffic control, independent of cloud-native orchestration systems like Kubernetes. It manipulates the packet path to bypass userspace proxies for certain connections, which is a core function of Kernel / Dataplane Networking as defined by the provided categories.",
yasindce1998/KubeDagger,Offensive Security,"The repository explicitly describes itself as a ""Kubernetes offensive framework built in eBPF"" and a ""rootkit that leverages multiple eBPF features to implement offensive security techniques."" Its features include container breakouts, persistent access, command and control, and bypassing security protections (RASP). This aligns perfectly with the definition of Offensive Security, which covers tools used for adversarial, exploitative, or red-team purposes. The intent is to demonstrate how to attack systems, not defend or observe them.",
xinity/k0s_cilium_playground,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository's explicit name, ""k0s_cilium_playground"", and its self-described purpose to provide a ""full cilium playground"" clearly establish its intent for learning and experimentation. The codebase consists of wrapper scripts that automate the setup of a complex, temporary environment (k0s clusters with Cilium clustermesh) using tools like `multipass` and `k0sctl`. This aligns perfectly with the definition of an educational resource, which includes projects designed for teaching, demonstrating concepts, and providing hands-on learning materials. The project itself does not perform networking or security functions; it simply creates a sandboxed environment where one can learn about or demonstrate Cilium's eBPF capabilities.",
krisnova/q,Observability,"The repository's explicit goal is to ""Surface Linux networking metrics with eBPF"". It uses eBPF kprobes to instrument kernel functions related to TCP connection requests and exposes metrics about kernel accept queues, such as queue length (`qlen`) and maximum size (`qmax`).

The tool provides visibility into a low-level system component without any security, networking control plane, or offensive intent.",
Xilinx/nanotube,"Platform, Runtime & Acceleration","The repository's primary purpose is to provide a compiler, libraries, and an API to offload eBPF XDP programs to FPGAs on SmartNICs. It takes eBPF C code and transforms it into HLS C++ for hardware synthesis. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Platform, Runtime & Acceleration', which includes systems that 'offload eBPF processing to specialized hardware such as SmartNICs, DPUs, FPGAs'. The project's focus is on changing the execution environment for performance gains, not on what the eBPF program itself does (e.g., networking or security).",
lizrice/learning-ebpf,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository's explicit and primary purpose is to provide the companion code examples for the O'Reilly book ""Learning eBPF"". The entire structure is organized by book chapters, containing small, focused programs designed to illustrate specific concepts (tracing, networking, security) for educational purposes. It is not a production-ready tool but rather a set of hands-on learning materials, which perfectly matches the definition of this class.",
edgebitio/edgebit-agent,Runtime Security,"The repository's main purpose is to use eBPF to ""track what packages are actively used by the system in order to ascertain which portions of the SBOM are relavent for vulnerability remediation."" This falls squarely into Runtime Security because it observes system behavior (which files/libraries are loaded) in real-time to detect a specific security condition: the active use of a known-vulnerable component. While it doesn't block malicious activity directly, it provides live, actionable intelligence on runtime exposure, which is a core function of modern runtime security tools. It interprets system signals through a threat-detection lens (Is a vulnerable library being used right now?) rather than for neutral performance monitoring (Observability) or pre-runtime hardening (Defensive Security).",
kris-nova/boopkit,Offensive Security,"The repository explicitly describes itself as a ""Linux rootkit and backdoor. Built using eBPF."" Its primary functionalities—remote command execution, network gateway bypass, and runtime process hiding—are all adversarial in nature. The tool is designed for post-exploitation, providing stealth and persistence, which directly aligns with the definition of the Offensive Security class. The inclusion of a Metasploit-compatible script further solidifies its classification as a red-team or offensive tool.",
kris-nova/boopkit,Offensive Security,"The repository explicitly defines itself as a 'Linux rootkit and backdoor' that uses eBPF for adversarial purposes. Its primary functions include spawning reverse shells for remote command execution, hiding its own process for stealth persistence, and using malformed TCP packets as a covert trigger. These capabilities align perfectly with the definition of Offensive Security, which covers tools designed for red-teaming, exploitation, and demonstrating how eBPF can be abused to subvert system security. The inclusion of a Metasploit-compatible script further solidifies its classification as an offensive tool.",
rprinz08/hBPF,"Platform, Runtime & Acceleration","The repository's explicit and primary goal is to implement an eBPF CPU in hardware (FPGA). The documentation states, ""this project now implements most of eBPF features in hardware (FPGA)"" and its purpose is to create a form of ""smart NIC"" capable of offloading tasks from the host CPU for performance reasons. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Platform, Runtime & Acceleration', which includes systems that ""offload eBPF processing to specialized hardware such as SmartNICs, DPUs, FPGAs.""

fuweid/embedshim,"Platform, Runtime & Acceleration","The primary purpose of `embedshim` is to provide a more efficient, low-overhead container task runtime implementation (a 'shim') for `containerd`. It uses an eBPF tracepoint on `sched_process_exit` to reliably and efficiently manage the lifecycle of container processes, solving a core operational problem in container management. This project is not concerned with security, networking, or application-level observability. Instead, it focuses on improving the performance and functionality of the underlying container platform itself. This aligns directly with the 'Platform, Runtime & Acceleration' category, as it serves as a foundational runtime component that accelerates and enhances the core infrastructure upon which all containerized workloads depend. It is a new runtime, enabled by eBPF, rather than a tool for observing or securing workloads.",

The content consists of a series of simple, well-documented examples (tracing syscalls, handling packets with XDP) with step-by-step instructions on how to compile, load, and run them. It even includes exercises designed to teach core concepts, such as modifying XDP return codes to observe different behaviors and deliberately causing the eBPF verifier to fail to understand its constraints. This structure and content align perfectly with the definition of an educational resource designed to demonstrate concepts and provide hands-on learning material.",
lizrice/ebpf-advent,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository's explicit goal is to implement ""Advent of Code"" challenges entirely in eBPF as a personal challenge. This is not a production-grade tool for security, networking, or observability. Instead, it serves as a creative and complex demonstration of eBPF's capabilities, showcasing how to perform tasks like file parsing and algorithmic logic directly in the kernel. Its nature as a set of puzzle solutions, combined with the author's reference to their 'Learning eBPF' book, firmly places it in the category of a resource designed to showcase, educate, and demonstrate concepts rather than solve an operational problem.",
Smana/cilium-gateway-api,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository's self-described main purpose is to 'demonstrate how Cilium implements the Gateway-API standard' and is explicitly linked to a blog post. It provides a complete, deployable example environment using Terraform and Flux, not as a reusable production tool, but as a reference for learning.

Its stated purpose is to ""gain deep insights"" and ""troubleshoot locking-related issues (e.g., performance problems or deadlocks)."" This aligns perfectly with the definition of Observability, which focuses on using eBPF to understand system behavior, diagnose problems, and analyze performance without a security goal. The tools collect telemetry (lock events, timings) and generate statistics and visualizations to help operators and developers understand application performance, which is a primary function of the Observability class.",
nttcom/fluvia,Observability,"The repository's primary function, as stated in its title, is to be an ""IPFIX Exporter using eBPF/XDP"". IPFIX is a standard protocol for exporting network flow telemetry. The tool uses eBPF at the XDP hook to efficiently capture packet and flow information, such as packet counts and path delays, and then exports this data for external analysis. This directly aligns with the definition of the Observability class: using eBPF to ""observe, measure, trace, or profile... networks without a security or adversarial goal."" The program's intent is not to enforce security policies (ruling out Runtime Security), nor to implement networking functions like routing or load balancing (ruling out Kernel/Dataplane Networking), but rather to provide visibility and telemetry about network traffic.",
kondukto-io/kntrl,Runtime Security,"The repository is explicitly described as an ""eBPF based CI/CD security tool"" and a ""runtime agent"". Its primary function is to ""monitor and prevent anomalous behaviour"" by observing kernel calls while a CI/CD pipeline is actively running. The tool includes a `prevent` mode that actively denies network access based on user-defined policies, such as allow-lists for hosts and IPs. The reporting output clearly shows policy enforcement decisions ('pass' or 'block'). This real-time monitoring, detection of policy violations, and active response (blocking) places it squarely in the Runtime Security category, as it is designed to defend a running workload against prohibited actions.",
pradhans0906/K8S-CNI-Cilium-Tutorial,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository's primary purpose is to provide an automated script for setting up a specific learning or demonstration environment: a k3s cluster with Cilium on macOS. The repository name explicitly includes ""Tutorial"", and the README describes it as a script to ""simplify the setup"". It does not implement any eBPF functionality itself, nor is it a production-grade operational tool.

It uses a kprobe to monitor the `setuid` syscall in real-time and generate alerts on suspicious activity, which is the core definition of a Runtime Security program. Although presented as a proof-of-concept with educational value, the demonstrated functionality—detecting and alerting on policy-violating behavior in an active system—is squarely within the Runtime Security domain. The intent is to show how to defend a running system against an active threat, which aligns with the security-focused, real-time nature of this category.",

This directly serves developer productivity by providing a specialized debugging and inspection utility. It does not perform monitoring, security, or networking itself; rather, it's a tool to aid in the creation of such programs, which is the exact definition of the Developer Tooling / Frameworks class.",
criblio/o11y-taming-tetragon,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository is explicitly a ""Demo Walkthrough"" designed to teach users how to integrate two existing tools: Tetragon (an eBPF-based security/observability agent) and Cribl Edge (a data pipeline tool).

cilium/cilium,Cloud Native Networking,"The repository's documentation explicitly describes Cilium as a 'networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane' primarily for containerized environments like Kubernetes. Its core features, such as being a CNI plugin, providing pod-to-pod connectivity, distributed load balancing (replacing kube-proxy), cluster mesh, and enforcing Kubernetes Network Policies, are all central to the definition of Cloud Native Networking. While it incorporates strong security and observability features, its fundamental purpose and primary function is to implement the network fabric and dataplane for cloud-native workloads. The classification rules clarify that when a project's main goal is traffic routing, service delivery, and connectivity within an orchestrated environment, it belongs in this category, which perfectly describes Cilium's role in the ecosystem.",
keyval-dev/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation,Observability,"The repository's explicit purpose is to provide ""OpenTelemetry Auto-Instrumentation for Go"" applications.

keisku/gmon,Observability,"The repository `keisku/gmon` is a tool designed specifically to monitor the creation, destruction, and uptime of goroutines within a Go program. Its primary function is to provide visibility into application behavior for debugging and performance analysis, which is the core tenet of the Observability class. The tool achieves this by tracing Go runtime functions using eBPF and exposing the collected data as logs with stack traces and metrics in the OpenMetrics format (e.g., `gmon_goroutine_creation`, `gmon_goroutine_uptime`). The project's intent is clearly not security-related (it doesn't detect malicious activity) or networking-focused (it doesn't manage traffic).

peter-mcconnell/whispers,Offensive Security,"The repository provides a tool that uses eBPF to hook the `libpam` library and dump credentials from memory as they are being used by services like `sshd` or `passwd`. This functionality is a classic example of credential exfiltration, which is a core aspect of offensive security tooling. The definition for the 'Offensive Security' class explicitly includes 'credential sniffers' and 'projects that demonstrate or simulate attacks — e.g., eBPF-based malware, credential sniffers... even if their intent is educational or research-oriented'. While the author states the project was created for a tech talk and is educational, the tool itself provides a functional, reproducible attack capability, making Offensive Security the most accurate classification.",
Netflix/bpftop,Observability,"The repository's main purpose is to observe and measure the performance of other running eBPF programs. Its functionality aligns perfectly with the definition of the Observability class: it provides a 'dynamic real-time view' of metrics like 'average runtime, events per second, and estimated total CPU %'.

microsoft/retina,Observability,"The repository explicitly describes itself as a 'Kubernetes network observability platform' and an 'eBPF distributed networking observability tool for Kubernetes'. Its core features are centered around collecting telemetry, generating Prometheus metrics, and enabling on-demand packet captures. The stated goal is to provide insight into application and network health for troubleshooting and monitoring, which aligns perfectly with the definition of the Observability class. While it mentions 'security' as a use case, its function is to provide neutral data ('collects customizable telemetry') for analysis, not to perform active threat detection or policy enforcement, which distinguishes it from the Runtime Security class.",
fomichev/xdp-btc-miner,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository's primary purpose is to demonstrate a novel and unexpected use of eBPF, specifically that a computationally intensive task like Bitcoin mining can be implemented in XDP. The README frames it as a proof-of-concept (""we are now able to implement..."") and a ""toy example,"" highlighting its limitations (16 loop iterations), which makes it completely impractical for actual mining. Its value is not in its function as a miner but in its role as a showcase for the expanding capabilities of the eBPF verifier and runtime, particularly BPF loops. This aligns perfectly with the definition of an Educational / Demonstration Resource, which focuses on teaching, experimentation, and demonstrating concepts rather than solving operational problems.",
dkorunic/pktstat-bpf,Observability,"The repository's primary purpose is to be a 'traffic monitor and reporting tool' that gathers 'packet statistics'.

Raihan-009/IPv6-packet-filter-xdp,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"Although the project implements a function that falls under Kernel / Dataplane Networking (an XDP-based packet filter), its primary intent is clearly educational. The repository provides a very simple, proof-of-concept program. The README includes detailed, step-by-step instructions for creating a temporary 'pseudo environment' for testing, which is typical for a tutorial. Most importantly, the 'References' section points exclusively to well-known eBPF learning materials and tutorials, such as 'lizrice/learning-ebpf' and the 'xdp-tutorial'.

The documentation explicitly states its purpose is to help users ""understand what's happening with your egress traffic"". The listed use cases, such as debugging network issues, API development, troubleshooting integrations, and validation testing, are all core to the Observability domain. Furthermore, the project's native support for exporting telemetry via OpenTelemetry (traces) and Prometheus (metrics), along with a sample Grafana dashboard, firmly places it within the observability ecosystem.

This aligns perfectly with the definition of Observability, which focuses on providing insight into system behavior for diagnostics and reliability. The tool answers the question, ""What is the current pressure on our BPF maps?"" rather than enforcing a security policy (Runtime Security), providing the network dataplane (Cloud Native Networking), or managing the lifecycle of Cilium itself (Operations, Orchestration & Lifecycle Management).

It consumes data from Hubble, which uses eBPF for deep network visibility. The tool's intent is not to enforce security, provide networking infrastructure, or exploit vulnerabilities. Instead, it aims to provide operational insight into network patterns, which is a core function of observability. Analyzing cross-AZ traffic is crucial for understanding application performance, latency, and cloud costs—all of which are key observability concerns.",
Outfluencer/Minecraft-XDP-eBPF,Runtime Security,"The repository's primary and explicitly stated purpose is to protect Minecraft servers from Layer 7 DDoS attacks in real time. It uses eBPF with XDP to inspect incoming network packets, detect malicious activity (invalid handshakes, connection throttling), and respond immediately by dropping packets and temporarily blacklisting IP addresses. This functionality perfectly matches the definition of Runtime Security, which includes programs that 'observe, detect, and respond to potentially malicious or policy-violating activity while a system or workload is actively running' and 'enforce runtime policies, such as blocking forbidden syscalls [or packets]'. While it operates in the networking dataplane, its intent is not general-purpose networking but active threat mitigation.",
jnesss/bpfview,Runtime Security,"The repository's primary intent is to observe, detect, and respond to malicious activity in real-time. The documentation prominently features ""powerful real-time detection"" and an ""Automated Response"" system capable of terminating processes and blocking network connections. Its integration with the Sigma detection standard for matching process behavior against threat rules, along with a concrete example of detecting and stopping a cryptocurrency miner, firmly places it in the Runtime Security category.

zimage/eBPF-drop-rfc-3514,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"Although the repository implements a packet filtering program that technically falls under 'Kernel / Dataplane Networking' or superficially appears to be 'Runtime Security', its entire premise is based on the satirical April Fools' Day RFC 3514 (the 'evil bit'). The project's sarcastic tone and lack of any real-world security application clearly indicate its primary intent is not production use. Instead, it serves as a humorous proof-of-concept and a showcase program. It demonstrates how to write a simple XDP program in an amusing context, perfectly aligning with the definition of an educational or demonstration resource designed to teach or illustrate a concept rather than solve an operational problem.",
adgaultier/caracal,Offensive Security,"The repository's primary intent is to use eBPF for adversarial purposes, specifically for stealth and evasion. Its main features are to ""hide target bpf programs & maps"" and ""hide target processes"" from standard system inspection tools like `bpftool` and `ps`.

It achieves this by using an eBPF/XDP program that operates in real time to inspect incoming network packets, detect activity that violates a predefined rate-limiting policy, and automatically respond by banning the offending IP address. This fits the definition of Runtime Security perfectly, as it observes, detects, and responds to malicious activity while the server is actively running. The functionality aligns with key indicators like runtime protection, detection, enforcement, live monitoring, and real-time response.",
isovalent/CKS-Study-Guide,Educational / Demonstration Resources,"The repository is explicitly a ""Study Guide"" designed to help candidates prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) exam. It consists of a curated list of educational resources such as labs, documentation, and videos. Its primary intent is to teach and provide learning materials, not to function as a deployable tool for security, networking, or observability. This directly matches the definition of the Educational / Demonstration Resources class, which includes projects created for teaching, training, or providing learning materials.",
SRodi/ebpf-server,Observability,"The repository's primary intent is to monitor, observe, and provide analytics on network and system events. The documentation explicitly states its purpose is to be a ""monitoring system with HTTP API server for real-time network and system event monitoring"" and to provide ""real-time network analytics"". Its features, such as a queryable API for events (connections, packet drops) with rich filtering and Kubernetes metadata enrichment, are characteristic of an observability tool designed to provide visibility and insight into system behavior. The project does not mention any security-related goals like threat detection, policy enforcement, or malicious activity prevention, distinguishing it from the Runtime Security class. It simply observes and reports what is happening, which is the core function of an Observability program.",
bombinisecurity/bombini,Runtime Security,"The repository explicitly describes itself as an ""eBPF security monitoring agent"". Its purpose is to run in real time, using various ""detectors"" to observe system behavior for security-relevant events. The instructions also mention checking for and enabling BPF LSM (Linux Security Module), a kernel feature designed for live monitoring and policy enforcement. This directly aligns with the definition of Runtime Security, which focuses on observing, detecting, and responding to potentially malicious activity as it happens on a running system.",
h0x0er/ebpf-snippets,Developer Tooling / Frameworks,"The repository's sole purpose is to provide code snippets for the VS Code editor to accelerate the development of eBPF programs. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Developer Tooling / Frameworks', which includes programs that 'help developers write, debug, test, build, and distribute eBPF programs more efficiently'. The inclusion rules for this class explicitly mention 'repositories that provide comprehensive developer documentation, tutorials, and snippets for building with eBPF', making this a perfect fit. The tool itself does not perform any runtime function; it is a utility for the developer's environment.",
free5gc/gtp5g-tracer,Observability,"The repository's explicit purpose is to ""Debug gtp5g kernel module using eBPF."" Its functionality is centered around tracing function calls within a specific kernel module (`gtp5g`) and viewing the output via `trace_pipe`. This aligns perfectly with the definition of the Observability class, which includes tools that ""use eBPF to observe, measure, trace, or profile systems, applications, or networks without a security or adversarial goal."" The tool's intent is to provide visibility and insight for developers, which is a core tenet of observability, rather than enforcing security, providing a network dataplane, or offering a generic development framework.",
rhargreaves/knock-knock,Runtime Security,"The repository's main intent is to protect TCP ports on a live system by enforcing a real-time access control policy. It uses eBPF to inspect incoming network packets and actively drops them until a correct sequence of UDP 'knocks' is received. This falls squarely under the definition of Runtime Security, as it uses eBPF to 'observe, detect, and respond' to policy-violating network activity in real time. The program's core function is to enforce a security policy dynamically by blocking unauthorized traffic, which is a key characteristic of this class.",
viktordoronin/stamp-bpf,Observability,"The repository provides an implementation of the STAMP protocol (RFC 8762), which is explicitly a ""network performance measurement protocol"". Its primary function is to use eBPF to timestamp packets at ingress and egress to calculate precise one-way and round-trip latencies. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Observability, which is to ""observe, measure, trace, or profile systems, applications, or networks without a security or adversarial goal."" The tool's output consists of metrics and histograms for performance analysis. While it operates on the kernel dataplane using `tc`, its intent is not to provide a networking service (like routing or filtering) but to generate telemetry about an existing network path, making it a classic observability tool.",
dynatrace-oss/koney,Runtime Security,"The repository's primary purpose is to deploy 'cyber traps' (honeytokens) and then use eBPF (via Tetragon) to detect, log, and alert on access to these traps in real time. This aligns directly with the definition of Runtime Security, which involves observing system activity (in this case, file access) to detect potentially malicious or policy-violating behavior while a system is running. The project's stated goals are to 'Deter Attackers' and 'Build Threat Intelligence' by generating security alerts, which is a core function of a runtime security tool.",
novartc/sipbench,Kernel / Dataplane Networking,"The repository's primary function is to serve as a high-performance SIP stress testing and benchmarking tool. It explicitly states that it achieves this performance by using eBPF/XDP for ""kernel-level packet processing for RTP media."" This directly aligns with the Kernel / Dataplane Networking category, which includes programs that use eBPF hooks like XDP to accelerate networking functions and process packets directly in the kernel. The tool's main intent is performance and packet path efficiency for a specific protocol (SIP/RTP), which is a classic use case for this category. It is not designed for security, general observability, or cloud-native orchestration.",

Its primary function is to collect this data and expose it via an API for querying recent executions. The project's intent is to observe and report what processes are running, which is a core function of observability. It lacks any mechanism for detecting malicious behavior, enforcing security policies, or generating alerts, which would be required for the 'Runtime Security' classification. It simply provides visibility into system activity without an adversarial context.",
zzzzz167/Larkspur,Observability,"The repository's one-line description, ""A real-time performance analyzer based on eBPF and Rust,"" places it squarely in the Observability category. The primary intent is to measure, trace, and profile system behavior for performance diagnostics, which is the core function of observability tools.

The inclusion rule ""Include tools that use eBPF to bypass existing security measures"" perfectly describes this tool's intent and functionality.",
parca-dev/oomprof,Observability,"The repository's primary function is to profile application memory usage at the moment of an Out-of-Memory (OOM) event. It uses eBPF tracepoints to observe kernel behavior and captures diagnostic data (heap profiles) for post-mortem analysis. This directly aligns with the definition of Observability, which focuses on understanding system behavior, diagnosing problems, and improving reliability and performance. The tool's goal is to provide insight ('Why did this process get OOM-killed?'), not to enforce security policies, manage networking, or provide a developer framework. The output is a standard `pprof` file, reinforcing its role as a performance analysis and debugging tool.",
Kagnite/Kernel-Ruler,Observability,"The repository describes itself as a ""terminal-based process monitoring tool"" and an `htop` + `pstree` alternative focused on ""real-time process execution tracking."" It uses eBPF to hook the `execve` syscall to observe and visualize the process hierarchy. This aligns perfectly with the Observability class, which focuses on using eBPF to observe, trace, and understand system behavior without an explicit security goal.

This is a classic observability task, focused on gathering diagnostic information about system and process behavior. It does not frame this monitoring within an adversarial context (e.g., detecting malicious activity), nor does it enforce policies or respond to threats, which would place it in a security category. Its intent is to provide insight into resource consumption, aligning perfectly with the definition of Observability.",
lac-dcc/honey-potion,Developer Tooling / Frameworks,"The repository's primary purpose is to enable developers to write eBPF programs using the Elixir programming language. It is explicitly described as a 'framework' that 'translates Elixir code into a subset of C' which is then compiled into eBPF bytecode. This squarely fits the definition of a Developer Tooling / Framework, as it provides an SDK-like experience, language bindings, and a build toolchain to make eBPF development more accessible. The project itself does not perform any security, networking, or observability functions; it is a tool for creating other eBPF programs.",
tiann/eadb,Developer Tooling / Frameworks,"The primary intent of `eadb` is to facilitate eBPF development and debugging on Android devices. It achieves this by creating a familiar Linux shell environment (via chroot) where standard eBPF toolchains like BCC, bpftrace, and bpftool can be installed and run. This directly addresses developer productivity by bridging the gap between a typical development setup and the constrained Android environment. The repository does not provide runtime security, observability, or networking functionality itself; rather, it provides the necessary tooling and environment for developers to build, debug, and test such eBPF programs for Android. Therefore, it fits squarely into the 'Developer Tooling / Frameworks' category.",
intel/istio-tcpip-bypass,Cloud Native Networking,"The repository's primary and explicit purpose is to accelerate the Istio service mesh by using eBPF to bypass the TCP/IP stack for communication between pods on the same host. This directly falls under the definition of Cloud Native Networking, which includes programs that 'use eBPF to implement, optimize, or extend networking capabilities within containerized or cloud-native environments — such as Kubernetes'. The project targets a specific cloud-native technology (Istio), is deployed via a Kubernetes DaemonSet, and aims to improve performance (latency) within that ecosystem. While it involves low-level packet handling, its context is not generic kernel networking but specifically service mesh optimization in a containerized environment.",
h3xduck/TripleCross,Offensive Security,"The repository explicitly describes itself as ""a Linux eBPF rootkit that demonstrates the offensive capabilities of the eBPF technology."" Its features are designed for adversarial purposes, including a backdoor with Command and Control (C2), library injection, execution hijacking, local privilege escalation, and stealth modules to hide its presence.

citronneur/pamspy,Offensive Security,"The repository's explicit purpose is to act as a ""Credentials Dumper for Linux"" by hooking the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) library to intercept and exfiltrate secrets from critical services like `sudo` and `sshd`. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Offensive Security, which includes tools used for adversarial, red-team purposes such as credential exfiltration and post-exploitation. The project is presented as an eBPF equivalent of `3snake`, a known penetration testing tool, further solidifying its classification as a tool built to attack or subvert systems, not defend or observe them.",
elesiuta/picosnitch,Runtime Security,"Picosnitch's primary function is to observe system behavior in real time and detect potentially malicious or policy-violating activity. Its core features, such as notifying users when new or modified programs connect to the network and optionally checking executable hashes against VirusTotal, align directly with the definition of Runtime Security. While it provides observability features like bandwidth monitoring, these are framed in a security context to help identify suspicious processes. The tool's intent is not neutral observation but active detection of security-relevant events, making it a classic example of a host-based runtime security monitor.",

OpenCloudOS/nettrace,Observability,"The repository's primary purpose is to provide an eBPF-based toolset for diagnosing network problems, tracing packet lifecycles through the kernel, monitoring packet drops, and analyzing network performance (latency, RTT). This aligns perfectly with the definition of Observability, which focuses on observing, measuring, and tracing system behavior for diagnostics and performance analysis without a security goal. The tool's 'diagnosis mode' identifies operational faults (e.g., misconfigurations, drops) rather than security threats, and its performance analysis features are classic observability use cases. It does not implement networking infrastructure or enforce security policies.",
preetpalbugs/linux-ebpf-profiler,Observability,"The repository's explicit goal is to provide a ""real-time view of the most frequently opened files"" and offer ""deep insights into system behavior."" This function is a classic example of observability, as it uses eBPF to trace and profile a specific system activity (file opens) for diagnostic and analytical purposes. The tool collects and presents telemetry data without any security enforcement, networking, or adversarial intent, fitting the definition of the Observability class perfectly. Although mentioned as a 'learning exercise', its primary presented function is that of a profiling tool.",
onzack/hubble-observer,"Operations, Orchestration & Lifecycle Management","While the end goal of this repository is to provide observability into Cilium network flows, its primary function is not to implement the eBPF logic itself. Instead, it provides a Helm chart that automates the deployment and configuration of an existing component (the Hubble container image) and integrates it with a visualization stack (Grafana and Loki). This repository acts as the 'operational glue' by managing the lifecycle of an eBPF-dependent observability agent. According to the class definitions, tools that 'manage, deploy, coordinate, configure, or automate the lifecycle of eBPF programs or systems that depend on them' belong in this category. The core contribution of this repository is the deployment package, not the eBPF instrumentation, making it a tool for operations and lifecycle management.",
varun-r-mallya/python-bpf,Developer Tooling / Frameworks,"The repository's primary function is to serve as a development tool. It provides a Python frontend that compiles Python code into eBPF-compatible LLVM IR and object files.

eunomia-bpf/schedcp,"Operations, Orchestration & Lifecycle Management","The primary intent of SchedCP is to act as an automated control plane for eBPF-based Linux schedulers (using the sched-ext framework). It orchestrates the entire lifecycle of these eBPF programs: it profiles workloads, uses an AI agent to select or even generate the optimal scheduler, deploys it, configures it, and monitors its performance. This falls squarely into the definition of 'Operations, Orchestration & Lifecycle Management' because its core function is to 'manage, deploy, coordinate, configure, or automate the lifecycle of eBPF programs' to achieve an operational goal (performance optimization). While it uses observability data as input, its main purpose is not just to observe but to automate the management and operational decisions for the underlying eBPF schedulers.",
twisted-pear/ipx_wrap,Kernel / Dataplane Networking,"The repository's primary function is to implement a network protocol translation layer using eBPF. Specifically, it uses BPF programs attached to the Traffic Control (TC) hooks to rewrite IPv6 packets into IPX packets on egress and vice-versa on ingress. This direct manipulation, filtering, and tunneling of packets within the Linux kernel networking stack is the core definition of Kernel / Dataplane Networking. The project is not specific to cloud-native environments, nor is its goal security or observability; its intent is to enable communication with a legacy network protocol by programming the kernel's packet processing path.",
